# AWS

It is not necessary that every region is enabled for a certain account. You can see in the following image, a couple of regions are disabled and we have to enable them in IAM.

By the way, we'd not be able to create resources in the disabled regions.

## AWS Global Dashboard

The Global dashboard gives us a detailed overview of our EC2 resources like subnets, VPCs, instances in specific regions. Its one-stop-shop for our EC2 resources.

We can use the global search option to see the instances, VPCs and security groups on a single page with their respective details.
